Gilbert shares his experience using Stucco on a personal project, a dice rolling module, and Jordan gets lost in the nerdery as the conversation moves to Tabletop RPG games. Once he is back on track we discuss the value of PowerShell meetups, and Gilbert gets the ball rolling for a bay area meetup.
