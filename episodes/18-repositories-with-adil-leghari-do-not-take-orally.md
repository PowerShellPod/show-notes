Episode Summary:

In this episode, we learned all about repositories and how to use them in a PowerShell context. We briefly discussed the challenges of working from Home. We learned how Adil got started in the PowerShell community including getting involved in the PowerShell Slack/Discord, attending PowerShell Summit, and even stepping up and helping put on an event: BridgeConf. Adil convinces Jordan to submit to speak at Summit 2023, and Jordan agrees. The crowd goes wild! We tried to capture the code that we ran on this episode in a transcript file, which can be found below.
