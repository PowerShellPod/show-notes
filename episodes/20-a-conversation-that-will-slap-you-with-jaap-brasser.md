[Episode Link](https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/e/a-conversation-that-will-slap-you-with-jaap-brasser/)

In this episode, Jaap tells us how he got into speaking at conferences. We talk about examples of how his support has helped people on their own speaking journey. We discuss a few of the recent talks he has given, from abstracting code to bettering your home automation. We get to discuss his Microsoft MVP being renewed a few hours before we recorded. Last, and probably most important, we learned that he submitted the slap with a fish function into Poshbot. A function that gets extensive use in our office.
